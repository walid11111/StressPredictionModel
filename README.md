📊 Student Stress Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to analyze the stress levels of students by examining various academic and personal factors. By building a predictive model, we hope to identify students who are at risk of stress, allowing institutions to take preventive measures and improve student well-being.

🚀 Project Overview
Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict stress levels among students using logistic regression, based on variables such as study hours, extracurricular activities, sleep patterns, and exam pressure.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes survey data from students, containing key metrics that impact their stress levels.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
🔍 Project Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
Visualized key relationships between stress levels and variables such as study hours, extracurriculars, and sleep.
Modeling:

Built a logistic regression model to predict whether a student is likely to experience stress based on the provided data.
Performed model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Results:

Accuracy: 82%
Precision: 0.80
Recall: 0.83
📊 Data Description
The dataset includes the following key features:

Study Hours: Number of hours a student studies daily.
Extracurricular Activities: Involvement in extracurricular activities.
Sleep Pattern: Average hours of sleep per night.
Exam Pressure: Self-reported exam pressure.
Stress Level: Binary target variable indicating whether a student is stressed or not.
